    This Dockerfile can be used to compile and run the "Hello" program. First, make sure Docker is installed, then `cd` into the `battle` directory and run:

    `docker build -t my_image_name .`

    Then, use

    `docker run --rm my_image_name`

    to run the image, which will compile the program and print its output -- you should see "Hello" on your screen.
